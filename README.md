> Excellence is never an accident. It is always the result of high intention, sincere effort, and intelligent execution; it represents the wise choice of many alternatives - choice, not chance, determines your destiny.

## Learning Objectives - The student should be able to..

* Create their own `for-in` loops where appropriate.
* Use `enumerate()` to get the `index` and `element` from the array.
*
* Create `Array` variables and constants and know how to use them.
* Know how to create an `Array` of `Int`'s and `String`'s. 
* Create functions that take in `Array`'s as arguments. 
* Access elements of the `Array` using *subscript syntax*.
* Change elements at a specific index using *subscript syntax*. 

## What the student can do at this point 

* Create variables and constants
* Is familiar with type annotations, type inference and string interpolation.
* Can create functions with return types.
* Is familiar with the String, Int, Double, and Bool type.
* Can perform arithmetic operations on Int and Double.
* Understands if and else clause statements.
* Can create and use Arrays. 
* Can iterate over an Array using a `for-in` loop.
* Can iterate over an Array calling `enumerate()`.
## Outline / Notes

* I've included a playground file with this repo to get it started. 
* I can see this playground containing 10-15 questions, with some easy wins in the beginning.
