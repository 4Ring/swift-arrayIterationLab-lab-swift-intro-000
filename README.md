> Excellence is never an accident. It is always the result of high intention, sincere effort, and intelligent execution; it represents the wise choice of many alternatives - choice, not chance, determines your destiny. -[Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle)

## Learning Objectives 

* Create your own `for-in` loops where appropriate.
* Use `enumerate()` to get the `index` and `element` from the array.
* Create `Array` variables and constants and know how to use them.
* Know how to create an `Array` of `Int`'s and `String`'s. 
* Create functions that take in `Array`'s as arguments. 
* Access elements of the `Array` using *subscript syntax*.
* Change elements at a specific index using *subscript syntax*. 

## Instructions

* Open up the playground file and answer the listed questions writing your code below each question.
* There are no tests associated with this playground file.
* Make sure render documentation is checked off which you can do in the Hide or show Utilities pane in the top right of the playground file.
